This is an early version with rough edges. The motivation for
writing this has been to improve my ability to write idiomatic 
Scala.

Since Voldemort isn't yet in any mainstream Maven repository you 
will need do edit ./project/build/ScalmertProject.scala to point
to a local repository that has voldemort-0.81.jar and 
voldemort-0.81-sources.jar installed.

Keep in mind that Voldemort's binary JSON serializer expects Java
collections rather than Scala collections. 

Feedback, criticism and patches are welcome.
